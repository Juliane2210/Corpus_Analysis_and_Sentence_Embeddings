The data for part 1 can be found here:

Use the Atticus dataset of legal contacts: [https://zenodo.org/record/4595826#.YyXT6HbMI2w](https://zenodo.org/record/4595826#.YyXT6HbMI2w)

Download the file CUAD_v1.zip, unzip, and see the folder **full_contact_txt**/

It contains 510 files with full text contracts (a collection of TXT files of the underlying contracts). Each file is named as “[document name].txt”. These contracts are in a plaintext format and are not labeled. You will need to concatenate all the text files to form a corpus.



The data for part 2 is in a zipped file, and can be found here:

Use the dataset from the **Semeval** 2016-Task1 Semantic Textual Similarity (STS).

Use the test data [STS Core (English Monolingual subtask) - test data with gold labels](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task1/data/uploads/sts2016-english-with-gs-v1.0.zip).
